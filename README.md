# RC-Plane - 1st & 2nd-Sem
Hands-on RC plane fabrication projects from 1st and 2nd semester – including workshop builds, competition entries, and flight-tested designs
# ✈️ RC Plane Projects – Aeronautical Engineering (1st & 2nd Sem)

Welcome to my RC Plane project collection! As an Aeronautical Engineering student, I got the opportunity to work hands-on with aircraft fabrication from my very first semester. These projects were done through workshops and competitions, where I gained experience in construction, teamwork, and flight performance.
